                    WARNING

The API is not yet stable.  This library isn't
ready to be used in a production environment yet.

Background
----------

    Tippett Studio has been using Shotgun in production for several years. 
During that time, we've developed a number of tools and processes that work with
data in Shotgun, almost all of which are written in Python.  Most of these   The
original API offered by Shotgun Software was quite simple

    

    Easy to use
    Easy to extend
    Where possible, don't allow creation of invalid objects



* Why don't you just auto-generate the whole API via xmlrpc introspection?

    API stability issues across versions
    Difficult to write
    Error-prone


Building
--------

  * The only dependency is the xmlrpc-c library, available at
    http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/  Make sure the xmlrpc-c-config binary is in
    your path so configure can find it.

  * --with-default-url
    Specify a URL to use by default when creating a Shotgun instance (you can
    always override it at runtime).  If you don't give it a default URL, 'make
    check' skips the tests, but you can still run them manually with a URL on
    the command line.

  * --enable-python
    Turning this on will also build the sip-based Python interface.
