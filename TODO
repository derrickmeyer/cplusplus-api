* Make classes for other entities

* Change Entity.m_sg from Shotgun* to Shotgun&, set in initializer

* Handle date/time fields correctly.  Need to take into account timezone,
  etc.  I believe shotgun stores date/times internally as UTC, so convert
  (correctly!) to/from local time (or other if specified).

* Make the python plugin build process better--get rid of configure.py
