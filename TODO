* Make classes for other entities

* Change Entity.m_sg from Shotgun* to Shotgun&, set in initializer

* Handle date/time fields correctly. Need to take into account timezone,
  etc. Shotgun stores date/times internally as UTC, so convert (correctly!) 
  to/from local time (or other if specified).

  Currently, "xmlrpc_c::value_datetime" class manipulates the global time
  zone variables, which makes the conversion from/to local time incorrect
  (with the difference between local time and UTC). 

  There is a Shotgun::setTimeZoneEnv() function which seems to do the trick
  by setting the "TZ" time zone environment varible. But it is not recommended
  and not being used right now.

* Make the python plugin build process better--get rid of configure.py

* In "/example/python/plugin/sip/_siteshotgun.sip", it is currently using
  "%Include" directive instead of "%Import" for importing the "_shotgun" 
  module. 

  "%Import" should have been the better way of importing the specification 
  of another module. The sip-generated cpp code compiles without any problem. 
  However, the "_siteshotgun" module doesn't seem to contain anything when 
  it is imported into Python.

  "%Include" includes all the contents of "_shotgun.sip". It works, but
  it regenerates all the cpp file related to "_shotgun" module and they will
  be built again for creating "_siteshotgun" module. This might not be a 
  big deal. It is just annoying that the code from "_shotgun.sip" will be
  built again whenever there is a need for be-build for "_siteshotgun".
